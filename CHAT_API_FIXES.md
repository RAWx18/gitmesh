# Chat API Error Handling Fixes

## Problem
The chat API was throwing `Error: [object Object]` due to improper error handling when Redis operations timed out. The frontend couldn't properly display error messages because it was receiving complex objects instead of strings.

## Root Causes
1. **Frontend Error Handling**: The chat API was trying to access `errorData.error` which might not exist or might be an object
2. **Redis Timeouts**: Redis Cloud was experiencing timeout issues with socket writes
3. **No Fallback Strategy**: When Redis failed, the entire operation failed instead of gracefully degrading

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Error Handling (`ui/lib/chat-api.ts`)
- **Improved error message extraction**: Now handles different error response formats
- **Better object serialization**: Converts error objects to strings when needed
- **Multiple error field support**: Checks for `error`, `detail`, and `message` fields
- **Fallback error messages**: Provides meaningful defaults when error data is malformed

### 2. Backend Redis Configuration (`backend/api/v1/routes/chat.py`)
- **Connection pooling**: Added Redis connection pool for better performance
- **Increased timeouts**: Socket timeout increased to 15s, connect timeout to 10s
- **Circuit breaker pattern**: Prevents cascading failures when Redis is down
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to in-memory storage when Redis fails

### 3. Environment Configuration (`backend/.env`)
- **Optimized timeout values**: Increased Redis timeouts to handle network latency
- **Connection pool settings**: Better connection management for Redis Cloud

### 4. Circuit Breaker Implementation
- **Failure threshold**: Opens circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- **Recovery timeout**: Attempts recovery after 60 seconds
- **State management**: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN states
- **Automatic fallback**: Uses in-memory storage when circuit is open

### 5. Health Monitoring
- **Health check endpoint**: `/api/v1/chat/health` for monitoring Redis status
- **Circuit breaker status**: Exposes current circuit breaker state
- **Redis ping test**: Tests actual Redis connectivity

## Benefits
1. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages instead of `[object Object]`
2. **Improved Reliability**: System continues working even when Redis is slow/down
3. **Faster Recovery**: Circuit breaker prevents repeated failed attempts
4. **Better Monitoring**: Health endpoint for system status
5. **Graceful Degradation**: In-memory fallback ensures chat functionality

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify error handling
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Circuit breaker status tracking

## Usage
The chat API will now:
1. Show proper error messages to users
2. Automatically fall back to in-memory storage if Redis fails
3. Recover automatically when Redis comes back online
4. Prevent system overload during Redis outages

## Monitoring
Check the health endpoint: `GET /api/v1/chat/health`
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "redis_available": true,
  "redis_circuit_breaker": {
    "state": "CLOSED",
    "failure_count": 0
  },
  "redis_ping": "success"
}
```
